### Abstract
Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (FSSL) aims to leverage unlabeled data across clients with limited labeled data to train a global model with strong generalization ability. Most FSSL methods rely on consistency regularization with pseudo-labels, converting predictions from local or global models into hard pseudo-labels as supervisory signals. However, we discover that the quality of pseudo-label is largely deteriorated by data heterogeneity, an intrinsic facet of federated learning. In this paper, we study the problem of FSSL in-depth and show that (1) heterogeneity exacerbates pseudo-label mismatches, further degrading model performance and convergence, and (2) local and global models' predictive tendencies diverge as heterogeneity increases. Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple and effective method called **S**emi-supervised **A**ggregation for **G**lobally-Enhanced **E**nsemble (SAGE), that can flexibly correct pseudo-labels based on confidence discrepancies. This strategy effectively mitigates performance degradation caused by incorrect pseudo-labels and enhances consensus between local and global models. Experimental results demonstrate that SAGE outperforms existing FSSL methods in both performance and convergence.

### Setup

1. Create a new Python environment:

   ```bash
   conda create --name sage python=3.8.18 
   conda activate sage
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Dataset

Supported datasets:

* CIFAR-10
* CIFAR-100
* CINIC-10
* SVHN

Before running, please ensure the dataset paths are correctly set in `options.py`.

### Usage

```bash
# 单次实验
bash scripts/train.sh --dataset CIFAR10 --alpha 0.1 --gpu_id 0

# CIFAR-10 α=0.1 与 0.5 连续跑
bash scripts/run_cifar10.sh --gpu_id 0

# 5 轮冒烟
bash scripts/debug.sh --gpu_id 0
```
